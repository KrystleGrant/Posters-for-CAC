# Posters-for-CAC
These are  posters I created for the Child Advocacy Center to help people be aware of the issues at hand. 
I was going for the shock factor when creating these posters and wanted them to be thought provoking and inspire 
people if they knew of something similar to this was happening, to look up the CAC. I wanted them to get the issues 
out there, and make people aware that so many children are silenced or scared about the violence and abuse they are 
experiencing in their lives.
